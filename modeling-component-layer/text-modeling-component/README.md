Contrastive Learning: Relaxed Contextualized word Mover Distance (CLRCMD)
==================

This repository reproduces the experimental result of CLRCMD (pronounced as "clear command") reported in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13196) to be appeared in ACL 2022 main track.

## 0. Download checkpoints
We want to upload our checkpoint to model registry such as huggingface hub to make them easily accessible, but due to the complicated process, we decided to just manually upload the checkpoint to our gdrive.
Please visit this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q-a7z2Xy09dThp3FtCVdH2GprcEykgaa?usp=sharing) to download the checkpoints we used in our experiment.
We assume the `pytorch_model.bin` is located in `/home/username/checkpoints/bert-rcmd/pytorch_model.bin`
